# A simple backend system with Kotlin, Spring Boot & JWT

## Description

This is a **Kotlin-based Spring Boot** project designed to help you learn how to build a basic backend system with **JWT authentication**.

The project is a simple **note-taking application**, where all data models are stored in **MongoDB**.

Using **token-based authentication**, this application allows users to:

- Create a new note
- Delete an existing note
- Retrieve all notes associated with their account

This project serves as a great starting point for understanding backend development with **Kotlin**, **Spring Boot**, **JWT**, and **MongoDB**.
